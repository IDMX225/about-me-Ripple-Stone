## üåê Description

This project is a personal "About Me" webpage built using HTML5 and CSS3. Throughout the course, I developed skills in writing semantic HTML, creating responsive layouts with media queries, and using CSS for design and interactivity. I learned how to create navigation bars, style image galleries, and build contact forms. The final touches include a custom logo, a blog section, and responsive optimization across devices. This project showcases both my technical progress and personal creativity, and serves as a piece I can include in my web design portfolio.

## üé® Color Scheme

| Element              | Color Name       | Hex       | RGB             |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Background           | Seafoam Gray     | #A4B9BA   | rgb(164, 185, 186) |
| Accent               | Slate Teal       | #52787A   | rgb(82, 120, 122) |
| Highlight/Border     | Bright Cyan Tint | #9DF4FA   | rgb(157, 244, 250) |
| Text Color           | Warm Brown       | #503828   | rgb(80, 56, 40) |

All colors have been checked using [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure readability and accessibility.

## Logo & Favicon
I created a personal monogram logo using my initials (MP) with a color scheme pulled from my site. The SVG logo appears in the header and the PNG version is used as a favicon in the browser tab. Both were styled and added manually through HTML. The image itself was made using the website canva.com: https://www.canva.com/dream-lab

## üß≠ Navbar + Hamburger Menu

The navigation bar includes anchor links to all key sections of the site. On smaller screens, it converts into a hamburger menu using HTML and CSS only ‚Äî without JavaScript. This provides users with a clear, responsive way to navigate the page.

## Nav Bar Design

The navigation bar on my About Me site uses a responsive hamburger menu that appears in smaller viewports (768px and below). It uses a simple checkbox toggle paired with CSS selectors to show and hide the menu. This eliminates the need for JavaScript while still offering a mobile-friendly experience.

The menu automatically transitions from a full-width horizontal bar to a collapsed icon with three lines, and clicking it reveals the links vertically. This ensures accessibility and readability across screen sizes including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
