## üåê Description

This project is a personal "About Me" webpage built using HTML5 and CSS3. Throughout the course, I developed skills in writing semantic HTML, creating responsive layouts with media queries, and using CSS for design and interactivity. I learned how to create navigation bars, style image galleries, and build contact forms. The final touches include a custom logo, a blog section, and responsive optimization across devices. This project showcases both my technical progress and personal creativity, and serves as a piece I can include in my web design portfolio.

## üß≠ Navbar + Hamburger Menu

The navigation bar includes anchor links to all key sections of the site. On smaller screens, it converts into a hamburger menu using HTML and CSS only ‚Äî without JavaScript. This provides users with a clear, responsive way to navigate the page.
