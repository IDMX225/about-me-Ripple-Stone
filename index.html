        <h2>Biography:</h2>

        <div>

            <p>My name is Michael Peck, and I'm currently pursuing a career in networking. I've always had a fascination with how digital systems connect the world together, and I'm working toward mastering that field. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring how technology influences communication and access to information. One of my biggest goals is to work in a role where I can build infrastructure that helps people — whether that's configuring servers or assisting with secure network setups.</p>
            
            <p>This course helped me gain skills I didn't expect to enjoy — like working with HTML and CSS. Even though web design isn't my final path, I've learned a lot about layout, accessibility, and the creative side of tech. I think that will help me stand out in future job opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Blog: Understanding Logical Fallacies and How They Work</h2>

  <p>In critical thinking and argumentation, logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that weaken an argument. They often seem persuasive on the surface, but fall apart when closely examined. Understanding fallacies is key to forming better arguments, recognizing flawed reasoning in others, and avoiding manipulation in media and everyday discussion. This blog explores some of the most common logical fallacies and how they function.</p>

  <h3>What is a Logical Fallacy?</h3>
  <p>A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning that undermines the logic of an argument. While some fallacies are accidental, many are used deliberately to mislead or distract. Fallacies often exploit emotional responses, assumptions, or shortcuts in reasoning. By learning to recognize fallacies, you become more resistant to false claims and propaganda.</p>

  <h3>Common Logical Fallacies</h3>

  <p><strong>Ad Hominem:</strong> Attacking the person instead of the argument. Example: “You can't trust her opinion on climate change—she failed high school chemistry!”</p>

  <p><strong>Straw Man:</strong> Misrepresenting your opponent's argument to make it easier to defeat. Example: “My opponent wants to cut military spending, which means she wants our country to be defenseless.”</p>

  <p><strong>Appeal to Emotion:</strong> Using emotional manipulation instead of logical reasoning. Example: “Think of the children! We must ban video games now!”</p>

  <p><strong>Slippery Slope:</strong> Arguing that a small step will inevitably lead to a chain of negative events. Example: “If we allow students to redo tests, next they'll want to skip class altogether.”</p>

  <p><strong>False Dichotomy (or False Binary):</strong> Presenting two options as the only possibilities. Example: “You're either with us, or you're against us.”</p>

  <p><strong>Red Herring:</strong> Introducing irrelevant information to distract from the real issue. Example: “Why worry about pollution when there are people who don't even have jobs?”</p>

  <p><strong>Post Hoc (Ergo Propter Hoc):</strong> Assuming that because one event happened after another, it was caused by it. Example: “I wore my lucky socks, and we won the game—so they must be the reason!”</p>

  <h3>Why They Matter</h3>
  <p>Fallacies don't just weaken debates—they can lead to harmful decisions. Political campaigns, media reports, and online discourse are often full of fallacies. When unchecked, these patterns of flawed logic contribute to polarization, misinformation, and distrust. Recognizing fallacies empowers you to engage more critically and thoughtfully with the world.</p>

  <h3>Tips for Avoiding Fallacies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Take time to examine claims logically.</li>
    <li>Ask for evidence and question assumptions.</li>
    <li>Don't let emotions override facts.</li>
    <li>Steelman opposing views—understand them in their best light.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Learning to spot fallacies is like giving your brain armor. It helps you filter noise, engage in healthier debate, and build arguments based on reason. It's a skill worth mastering in both academic and everyday life.</p>
