        <h2>Biography:</h2>

        <div>

            <p>My name is Michael Peck, and I'm currently pursuing a career in networking. I've always had a fascination with how digital systems connect the world together, and I'm working toward mastering that field. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring how technology influences communication and access to information. One of my biggest goals is to work in a role where I can build infrastructure that helps people — whether that's configuring servers or assisting with secure network setups.</p>
            
            <p>This course helped me gain skills I didn't expect to enjoy — like working with HTML and CSS. Even though web design isn't my final path, I've learned a lot about layout, accessibility, and the creative side of tech. I think that will help me stand out in future job opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Blog: Understanding informal fallacies/my notes on them</h2>

        <div>

            <p>Can be right but still informal.</p>

  <p>Moves in an argument that are not “good” moves.</p>

  <p>Ad hominem = Insults towards the enemy, sometimes weakens argument. You can be right but still do this.</p>

  <p>Appeal to emotion = Associate emotional appeal to argument.</p>

  <p>Slippery slope = Assert that the occurrence or not occurrence will come in associated with something else. Can be true but the method may ruin your argument strength.</p>

  <p>All gray areas that can be true but are not good methods to get others to understand.</p>

  <p>STRAW MAN ARGUMENT = When you misrepresent opponents argument to make it seem weaker than it is so it's easier to defeat.</p>

  <p>You can take any perspective in anything and still make it an informal fallacy.</p>

  <p>(Note: Steelman argument = Taking the best version of opponents argument and strengthening it, THIS IS GOOD.)</p>

  <h3>Red Herring</h3>

  <p>Red Herring: Intentionally attempting to change the subject and divert the opponent's perspective.</p>

  <p>Appealing to Authority is a type of red herring = Instead of pointing the reason for your point you instead point to a position of authority/power saying that they said it so it must be true. Something is merely true or false because a position of authority says so.</p>

  <p>Stanley Milgram = Electric.</p>

  <p>Ad Populum = Because of a large group of people saying it's true it must be true.</p>

  <p>Post Hoc (Ergo post hoc) = The assumption that something that initially happened caused something later in the day. Ex: I ate a different piece of toast an hour ago, my arm hurts, it must have been that toast.</p>

  <p>False Dichotomy = When someone presents you with 2 options as if they are the only 2 options. False Binary.</p>

  <h3>Fallacies Mixed with Cognitive Distortions</h3>

  <p>Confirmation Bias = Only observes and determines validity through their personal or biased experience rather than other perspectives.</p>

  <p>Loaded Questions = A question that is laced with an acceptance of something, then any answer to that question will force the opponent to accept this thing. When did you stop hating people? Yes or no?</p>

  <p>Availability Heuristic = Intuition based associations to things you have experienced that alter your perspective of validation towards an answer.</p>
